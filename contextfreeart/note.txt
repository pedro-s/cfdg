Source.
These cdfg files came from contextfreeart.org, creative commons license.

Contents, Manifest.
bash.txt= the bash file that was ran to compile the cfdg script files.
out/= the result of bash.txt.
logapp.log= full log with all details. 6.4mb.
error.txt= the error messages extracted from logapp.log.
note.txt= this file.
contextfreeart/= this folder. 2,657 items, totalling 143.8 MB.

To do.
extract other types of error messages from logapp.log, for example: "Couldn't open rules file".
fix errors. Should fixed files be renamed?
create htm index file.

More notes.
the cfdg files with numbers as names are old and were renamed.
The renaming is probably the reason for the message "Couldn't open rules file".
